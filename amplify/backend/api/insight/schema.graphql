# This "input" configures a global authorization rule to enable public access to
# all models in this schema. Learn more about authorization rules here: https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/graphql/authorization-rules

# About the !: It means that field is required
# About AWSJSON: It is a JSON string

# About the ID type:
# It can be treated as a string, and we can write strings to ID fields
# It must either be a string or integer -- we can standardize to string
# Reference: https://spec.graphql.org/October2016/#sec-ID

# About @auth rules:
# We want to only allow the owners to read/mutate their own jobs
# We specify ownerField to be "user_id" so Amplify will automatically write the Cognito user ID into user_id
# This means we do not have to specify it ourselves!
# Reference: https://docs.amplify.aws/javascript/build-a-backend/graphqlapi/customize-authorization-rules/#per-user--owner-based-data-access

# Job has its own 'id' column (auto-generated, not shown here)
# user_id will be the secondary index
